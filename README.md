Hi, this is my first Github Repository, I'm currently a newbie at coding and I made this cool tictactoe game where you can play with a bot or a player
although the bot isn't even a bot and is just putting tiles in random place, but it's still fun to play with it if you have no other people to play with (this is subject to change)
and the cool thing about the bot is when you lose, the bot will roast you with some kind of Passive aggressive insults

so, Introducing! Tic Tac Toe : Command Prompt Edition,
the game's mechanic is a bit complicated, it uses the Coordinate Geometry method

so, first, when you start the python game, you'll be greeted with an input to choose between gamemodes

type BOT if you want to play with a bot, and type PLR if you want to play with another player. (or type anything to randomly choose any of the modes)

then, the game will start, now you need to input the coordinate of the tile you want to put at, you need to input the height, then length

if you put anything that isn't the game's tile, an ouput will tell an example of a valid empty tile.

in this case, i'll put 00 and see where it goes.

not soon after you write the first tile, the bot will write his tile, the bot was delayed for satisfaction purposes
and the game goes on until you win/lose/tie

winning game

losing game (insults can vary)

tie game

while the Player vs Player Mode, works almost the same as bot

in this case, Player 1 moves the tile "O" while the second moves the tile "X" until one of them wins/tie
or, if you prefer, you can play by yourself for maybe some kind of training or whatever it is.

That's it for the game, it may be not the best, but it was the best project i've worked on so, i wanted to share it with you guys.

Thanks!
